# Clock-Divider
A clock divider is a digital circuit that takes an input clock signal and produces an output clock signal with a lower frequency. Clock dividers are commonly used in digital systems to provide slower clock signals to different parts of the system, especially when the components require different clock frequencies. 

In this design, the frequency of the output clk_out is equal to the frequency of the input clk_in divided by the value of the ratio(32-bit value) in the Verilog code. In the Code, We have an input clock signal called 'clk_in' with a frequency of 20MHz. In the Simulation, it can be observed that the clk_out has different frequencies because of the variations in the input ratio. For example, for the first 10ms, the ratio is 20,000. So, 20MHz/20,000=1kHz which gives the output clock signal of frequency 1kHz. Similarly, ratio = 10,000 gives clk_out of 2kHz frequency and the ratio = 5000 gives clk_out of 4kHz frequency.
